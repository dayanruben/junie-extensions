# Junie Extensions

Curated extensions for [Junie](https://www.jetbrains.com/junie/) — the AI coding agent by JetBrains.

Extensions give Junie domain expertise: best practices, code patterns, anti-patterns, and checklists for specific technologies. Each extension can include skills (knowledge files), agents, guidelines, and MCP servers (tools).

## Structure

Each extension lives in `extensions/<name>/` and may contain:

```
extensions/<name>/
  extension.json          # name + description
  skills/<skill-name>/
    SKILL.md              # main skill file
    references/           # optional detailed references loaded on-demand
  agents/                 # optional custom agent definitions
  guidelines/             # optional project-level guidelines and conventions
  mcp/
    .mcp.json             # optional MCP server definitions
```

**`skills/`** — knowledge files that give Junie domain expertise. Each skill has a main `SKILL.md` and optional `references/` loaded on-demand.

**`agents/`** — custom agent definitions for specialized workflows within the extension's domain.

**`guidelines/`** — project-level conventions, coding standards, and decision records that Junie should follow when working on the project.

**`mcp/`** — MCP server definitions that provide additional tools (databases, APIs, etc.) for the extension.

### Skill Format

```markdown

name: "skill-name"
description: "One-line description."

# Title

## Reference Guide         ← hub-and-spoke: table pointing to references/
## Key Patterns            ← quick-start code examples
## Constraints             ← MUST DO / MUST NOT DO
```

Reference files are loaded on-demand based on context — only the relevant ones are read for each task.
